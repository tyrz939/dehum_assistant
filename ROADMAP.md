# Dehumidifier Assistant - Project Roadmap

## üéØ Core Vision
Transform the dehumidifier assistant from a basic chat interface into a comprehensive business tool that:
- Qualifies leads through intelligent conversation
- Provides accurate sizing calculations
- Answers technical questions using a knowledge base
- Seamlessly hands off complex cases to human experts
- Integrates directly into WordPress/Elementor for maximum reach

## ‚úÖ Completed Features
- Chat widget with responsive design
- WordPress integration and admin interface  
- Conversation logging and session management
- Rate limiting and security
- Git-based automatic updates
- Encrypted credential storage
- Database performance optimization
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system is built on a three-tier architecture to optimize each layer's strengths:

- **WordPress Plugin (UI Layer)**: Handles the chat interface, Elementor integration, conversation logging, and admin dashboard.
- **Python AI Service (Intelligence Layer)**: An AI agent with tools for sizing calculations, a RAG pipeline for technical Q&A, and conversation management. It uses LiteLLM for model flexibility.
- **n8n Workflows (Business Intelligence Layer)**: Manages lead scoring, email automation, CRM integration, and analytics routing.

### **Data Flow**

```

### **Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Native WordPress integration** (PHP handles UI/logging)
- ‚úÖ **Powerful AI with full control** (Python handles complex AI logic and RAG)
- ‚úÖ **Model flexibility** (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Llama with no vendor lock-in)
- ‚úÖ **Business automation** (n8n handles lead intelligence and integrations)
- ‚úÖ **Easy debugging** (Python AI service can be developed/tested independently)
- ‚úÖ **Scalable architecture** (each layer can be optimized independently)
