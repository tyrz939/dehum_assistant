# Dehumidifier Assistant - Project Roadmap & Vision

## üéØ Core Vision
Transform the dehumidifier assistant from a basic chat interface into a comprehensive business tool that:
- Qualifies leads through intelligent conversation
- Provides accurate sizing calculations
- Seamlessly hands off complex cases to human experts
- Integrates directly into WordPress/Elementor for maximum reach

## üèóÔ∏è **AGREED ARCHITECTURE: PHP Plugin + n8n Hybrid**

### **Architecture Decision**
**Hybrid approach combining WordPress-native PHP plugin with self-hosted n8n workflows:**

- **PHP Plugin (UI Shell)**: WordPress integration, Elementor widget, chat interface, local logging, admin dashboard
- **n8n Workflows (Intelligence Engine)**: AI processing, sizing calculations, lead scoring, external integrations, data routing

### **Division of Responsibilities**
```
User Interaction ‚Üí PHP Plugin ‚Üí n8n Webhook ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Response
                      ‚Üì                           ‚Üì
              WP Database                External Systems
              (conversations)            (CRM, email, etc.)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Native WordPress integration (PHP handles what PHP does best)
- ‚úÖ Powerful AI workflows (n8n handles complex logic)
- ‚úÖ Future-proof (easy to modify workflows without touching WordPress)
- ‚úÖ Scalable (add integrations without code changes)
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective (self-hosted n8n, no monthly fees)
