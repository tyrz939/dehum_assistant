# Dehumidifier Assistant - Project Roadmap & Vision

## üéØ Core Vision
Transform the dehumidifier assistant from a basic chat interface into a comprehensive business tool that:
- Qualifies leads through intelligent conversation
- Provides accurate sizing calculations
- Seamlessly hands off complex cases to human experts
- Integrates directly into WordPress/Elementor for maximum reach

## üèóÔ∏è **UPDATED ARCHITECTURE: WordPress + Python AI Service + n8n Business Intelligence**

### **Architecture Decision**
**Three-tier architecture optimized for each layer's strengths:**

- **WordPress Plugin (UI Layer)**: Chat interface, Elementor integration, conversation logging, admin dashboard
- **Python AI Service (Intelligence Layer)**: AI agent with tools, sizing calculations, conversation management, model-agnostic design
- **n8n Workflows (Business Intelligence Layer)**: Lead scoring, email automation, CRM integration, analytics routing

### **Division of Responsibilities**
```
User Interaction ‚Üí WordPress ‚Üí Python AI Service ‚Üí n8n Business Intelligence ‚Üí External Systems
                     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
                WP Database    AI Processing        Lead Automation
                (conversations)  (tools/sizing)    (CRM/email/analytics)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Native WordPress integration** (PHP handles UI/logging)
- ‚úÖ **Powerful AI with full control** (Python handles complex AI logic)
- ‚úÖ **Model flexibility** (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Llama with no vendor lock-in)
- ‚úÖ **Business automation** (n8n handles lead intelligence and integrations)
- ‚úÖ **Easy debugging** (Python AI service can be developed/tested independently)
- ‚úÖ **Scalable architecture** (each layer can be optimized independently)

- **Implementation**: AI prompt engineering + Python validation logic
- **Benefits**: Prevents off-topic usage, maintains professional focus
- **Example**: "I can only help with dehumidifier sizing and selection. How can I assist with your humidity control needs?"
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 5. **Comprehensive Chat Logging**
- **Goal**: Log all conversations for business intelligence and review
- **Implementation**: WordPress-side logging system with admin dashboard
- **Features**:
