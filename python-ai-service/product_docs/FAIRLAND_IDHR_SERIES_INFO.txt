- Energy efficiency: Average DER ≈ 4.3 L/kWh @ 30 °C / 80 % RH (≈ 50% lower running cost vs non-inverter).
- Sound: Marketing minimum ~35.3 dB(A) @ 1 m (low speed). Spec tables list typical bands ~38–46 dB(A).
- Auto defrost, power-loss auto-restart, anti-corrosion coils, splash-resistant metal/aluminium chassis.
- Optional electric heater element (size varies by model; see per-model blocks).
- App features: On/Off, set humidity (30–95 %RH), Smart/Silence mode, basic scheduling, status readouts.

NOTE_ON_AIRFLOW_SPECS:
- Two published airflow sets exist (manufacturer revisions):
  • Set A: 600 / 800 / 1000 m³/h (IDHR60/96/120)
  • Set B: 600 / 1000 / 1200 m³/h (IDHR60/96/120)
- Treat airflow as model-revision dependent. Confirm on the product dataplate or latest sheet.

============================================================
# 3) OPERATING LOGIC (HOW IT CONTROLS HUMIDITY)
- Power on → controller senses RH → fan starts immediately.
- If RH ≤ setpoint: compressor stays off; fan can remain at low speed (P1=0 default) or stop (P1=1).
- If RH > setpoint: compressor ramps from 0 Hz → ~90% for ~1 min → 100% until close to target.
- Near target: inverter modulates ~45–80% duty to hold steady RH (Smart/Silence curves differ).
- Hysteresis: ~1% below setpoint → compressor stops; fan at low (default). Above setpoint → auto restart.
- 3-minute start delay protects the compressor after power-up.

MODES:
- SMART: Wider 20–100% modulation band (fast pull-down → efficient steady state).
- SILENCE: 20–80% cap for quieter operation.

SETPOINT_RANGE: 30–95 %RH (panel & app)
TIMER: One-shot countdown on/off (not recurring)

# 5) FAULT / ERROR CODES (GROUPED FOR TRIAGE)

E-CLASS (installation/environment/power)
E1  High pressure protection — Check outlet obstruction (<1 m rule), fan operation, HP switch/wiring.
E2  Low pressure protection — Suspect low charge/leak; verify pressures & frost pattern, find/repair leak, refill.
E5  Abnormal supply (single-phase ≤175 V or ≥270 V). Recovers 180–255 V.
E7  Electric heater overheat (manual reset thermostat, or airflow issue).
E8  Exhaust gas over-temperature — Check airflow, charge, sensor seating.
EA  Air outlet over-temperature — Check airflow blocks/fan.
Eb  Ambient out of range (<10 °C or >38 °C). Wait or move to compliant space.

F-CLASS (inverter/compressor/fan electronics)
F1  Compressor drive module/wiring fail
F2  PFC module failure
F3  Compressor start failure
F4  Compressor running failure
F5  Inverter board overcurrent
F6  Inverter board overheat
F7  Overcurrent (may clear on restart; persistent → investigate)
F8  Radiator/cooling plate overheat (clean fins, check fan)
F9  DC fan fault (wiring/board/fan)
FA  PFC module overcurrent

P-CLASS (controls/sensors/comm)
P0  Controller communication failure
P1  Inlet/ambient temp sensor fault
P2  Outlet air temp sensor fault
P3  Exhaust gas temp sensor fault
P5  Gas return temp sensor fault
P6  Evaporator coil temp sensor fault
P7  Ambient humidity sensor fault
P8  Cooling plate sensor fault
P9  Current sensor fault
PA  DIP/memory mismatch (check DIP before board swaps)

TECH TIP: For board replacements, set DIP switches correctly before power-up. Wrong DIP → PA/F-class errors or overcurrent trips.

============================================================
# 6) INSTALLATION & ELECTRICAL (AU/EU PRACTICALS)

PLACEMENT:
- ≥2 m from pool edge; ≥1 m clear in front of outlet; keep inlet/outlet unobstructed.
- Well-ventilated space; avoid corrosive or explosive atmospheres; keep away from open flame.
- Floor: fit feet; Wall: use M6 anchors into solid concrete; hang on supplied bracket; fit rear pads to protect wall.
DRAIN:
- Fit hose to drain spigot; maintain continuous fall; avoid kinks/traps; test for free flow.
ELECTRICAL:
- 230V/1Ph/50Hz; must be earthed; fit RCD/RCBO ≤30 mA.
- Suggested protective devices: IDHR60 8A, IDHR96 10A, IDHR120 12A (verify against dataplate/revision).
- Keep power and signal leads separated/ordered; upsize cable section if runs >10 m or warm locations.
START-UP:
- First power-on: fan starts; compressor has ~3 min delay. Check for abnormal noise/vibration; verify drain.

============================================================
# 7) MAINTENANCE

- Annual service by a qualified technician: electrical inspection, coil clean, drain check, refrigerant circuit leak check.
- User cleaning: mild detergent/water on panels only; no solvents/pressure washing.
- Filter (bottom access): inspect and clean regularly in dusty environments.
- Storage/idle: power off, cover to prevent dust ingress; keep upright during transport.

============================================================
# 8) CONNECTIVITY / APP (PAIRING MODES)

PAIRING_METHODS: Bluetooth Auto-Discovery (if module supports), EZ Mode, AP Mode.
BASIC STEPS:
- Wake panel; long-press Wi-Fi (~3 s for EZ / ~10 s for AP). Indicator flashes (fast = EZ, slow = AP).
- Use app “Add Device”; connect to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi; complete binding. For AP, join device hotspot when prompted.
RE-BIND:
- Long-press Wi-Fi ~10 s to clear old credentials, then re-add.

APP CONTROLS (NO HEATER MODEL SHOWN):
- On/Off, Smart/Silence, Set RH, live Temp/RH display, simple timer, device sharing.

============================================================
# 9) PERFORMANCE & CURVES (WHAT TO EXPECT)

DER (EFFICIENCY): Average ≈4.3 L/kWh @ 30 °C / 80 %RH (marketing data). 
RELATIONSHIPS:
- Lower ambient temp → lower moisture capacity and often higher DER (L/kWh) at partial load.
- Curves available (per model) for capacity (L/h) vs ambient temp and for DER vs temp at three bands:
  • 100% (full speed), ~81%, and “low speed” (~50%). Use for fine sizing margin if needed.

NOISE:
- Marketing minimum ~35.3 dB(A) at 1 m (low speed); spec tables show typical ranges 38–46 dB(A).

============================================================
# 10) SIZING NOTES (FIELD-ORIENTED, NON-BINDING)

POOL ROOMS:
- Manufacturer guidance (still air, typical indoor pool usage):
  • IDHR60 → pool surface ≤25 m², room 50–120 m²
  • IDHR96 → pool surface ≤40 m², room 80–200 m²
  • IDHR120 → pool surface ≤50 m², room 100–240 m²
- Real load varies with water temp, air temp/RH target, activity, evaporation control (covers), and air movement.
- For active pools, ventilation spikes, or warm water (≥30 °C), add margin (step up one model) or combine with ventilation control.

GENERAL ROOMS:
- Use advised room size as a guide with caveats: infiltration, source moisture, and air velocity can dominate. 
- Verify airflow path and recirculation across the wet surfaces; avoid short-circuiting supply to return.

============================================================
# 11) SAFETY & LIMITS (ALWAYS ENFORCE)

- Do not operate outside 10–38 °C ambient.
- Only licensed personnel may perform refrigerant work (R32).
- Gas leak check before/after any refrigeration intervention.
- Keep children away from mains isolator; isolate power in thunderstorms.
- Never block inlet/outlet; never use near flammable vapors.

============================================================
# 12) FAQ-STYLE SNIPPETS (RETRIEVAL-FRIENDLY)

Q: Does the IDHR series include an electric heater?
A: Heater is optional. Nominal sizes: IDHR60 ~1.3 kW; IDHR96/120 ~2.1 kW. Confirm fitted option on the unit.

Q: What’s the humidity set range?
A: 30–95 %RH via panel/app.

Q: Can the fan stop after reaching setpoint?
A: Yes—set P1=1 (default is P1=0 → fan low speed at setpoint).

Q: What breaker and RCD do I use?
A: Guide: 8A (60), 10A (96), 12A (120) with RCD ≤30 mA. Verify against the unit’s dataplate/revision.

Q: Minimum/maximum operating temperature?
A: 10–38 °C ambient. Outside this range performance is not guaranteed and protective trips may occur.

Q: How loud is it?
A: Typical 38–46 dB(A) at 1 m per model/spec. Marketing claims a ~35.3 dB(A) minimum at low speed.

============================================================
# 13) DATA INTEGRITY / REVISION NOTES

- Airflow values and “advised room size” ranges have published variations between brochures/manuals and product revisions.
- Always treat the unit dataplate as the highest authority when commissioning or specifying protective devices.
- DER and noise “headline” numbers are marketing averages/minimums; use the tabulated bands for conservative planning.
