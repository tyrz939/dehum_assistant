## 3. Capacity Derating

Capacities are rated at 30°C/80%RH (AHAM). At lower temperatures/humidity:

* Below 20°C: capacity may drop 40–60%
* Below 60% RH: drop 30–50%
* Cool + dry: drop up to 60–70%

Example: DA-X140i rated at 155 L/day may only achieve \~50–70 L/day at 15°C/50%RH.

---

## 4. Safety Instructions

Warnings:

* Disconnect power before installation/maintenance
* Wear PPE (gloves, safety glasses) – sharp edges
* Heavy unit – use 2+ people/lifting equipment
* Hot surfaces – allow 15 min cool-down

Cautions:

* Not for unsupervised use by children or persons with reduced capability
* Do not install near explosive/flammable gases or corrosive chemicals
* Indoor use only – protected from rain/flooding
* No extension cords – plug direct into grounded outlet

Notices:

* Do not block inlets/outlets
* Operate within 5°C–43°C
* If stored/transported on side – stand upright 24h before use
* Use only approved parts/accessories

---

## 5. Installation Guidelines

Location: Indoors (attic, plant room, ceiling void), above dew point. Avoid unconditioned/uninsulated spaces.

Mounting: Secure to joists/slab with brackets/straps; ensure level. Use vibration isolation if above living spaces.

Clearances: ≥600 mm at filter access side, ≥300 mm elsewhere; ducts accessible.

Ducting: Rigid, insulated preferred; supply/return Φ200 mm, fresh air Φ150 mm; flexible last section to reduce vibration; seal joints.

Fresh Air: Intake away from pollutants/heat; install backdraft damper. Use insulated ducting to prevent condensation. Keep runs short and minimise bends to reduce static pressure.

Drainage: Factory manual specifies P-trap; some guidance recommends NO P-trap for positive-pressure drains – confirm latest advice. Slope ≥2%, no kinks; condensate pump if no gravity drain. Secondary drain pan recommended if installed above living spaces.

Electrical: Dedicated 220V/50Hz, grounded, ±10% voltage stability, isolator switch nearby; by licensed electrician.

Sensors: Install per manual; ensure unobstructed airflow.

Ambient Range: Operate between 5°C and 43°C for optimal performance.

## 6. Working Principle

Fresh + return air drawn into unit, filtered (G4 + HEPA), dehumidified via inverter compressor, supplied to living spaces. Fresh air volume modulated via electric damper for balanced ventilation.

---

## 7. Filtration

* G4 (Primary): EN779 G4, ISO Coarse 60%+, 229×355×10 mm, washable/replacable, inspect monthly, replace every 3–6 months.
* HEPA H13: EN1822 H13, ≥99.95% @0.3 µm, 229×355×57 mm, replace only, inspect quarterly, replace every 6–12 months.

E2: Supply Air Temp/RH sensor fault
E3: Coil Temp sensor fault
E4: Fresh Air Temp/RH sensor fault
E5: High Pressure Protection
E6: Low Pressure Protection
E7: Phase Loss/Sequence fault
E8: Compressor Overload
EE: IPM Module Fault
P0: Compressor Drive Protection
P1: Anti-Freeze Protection
P2: Compressor High Temp Protection
P3: Current Protection
P4: Condenser High Temp Protection
P5: Outdoor Unit Protection
F1: Supply Fan Fault
F2: Fresh Air Damper Fault
F3: Controller–Display Comm Fault
F4: EEPROM Fault

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Tips

* **No Power:** Check breaker, wiring, isolator switch.
* **No Dehumidification:** Check filters, setpoint, sensors.
* **Excessive Noise:** Inspect ducts, fan balance, mounting isolation.
* **Water Leakage:** Clear drain, check slope, inspect P-trap.
* **High Humidity Persists:** Check for air leaks, coil cleanliness, sizing.
* **Fresh Air Not Flowing:** Check damper motor, duct blockage.

## 10. Maintenance

Monthly: Inspect G4 filter.
Quarterly: Clean drain pan/hose; inspect electrical connections; inspect HEPA.
6–12 Months: Replace HEPA; professional service check.
Annually: Full inspection – coils, fans, sensors.

---

## 11. Warranty

5 Years Parts / 2 Years Labour – valid with qualified install & maintenance.
Excludes wear/tear, consumables, damage from improper install, acts of nature, or power surges.
