## 3. Capacity Derating & Performance Notes

**IMPORTANT:** All dehumidifier capacities are rated at **30°C, 80% RH** (AHAM standard conditions). Performance will drop considerably at lower temperatures and humidity levels:

* **Lower temperatures** (below 20°C): Capacity can drop 40-60%
* **Lower humidity** (below 60% RH): Capacity can drop 30-50%
* **Combined effect** (cool + dry conditions): Capacity may drop 60-70%

**Example:** A DA-X140i (155L rated) at 30°C/80%RH may only extract 50-70L/day at 15°C/50%RH.

Always size dehumidifiers based on actual site conditions, not just rated capacity. Consult with technical support for site-specific sizing.

## 5. Installation & Mounting

* **Location:** Indoor only; attic, plant room, ceiling void, or service area above dew point
* **Mounting:** Secure to joists/slab using brackets/straps; level installation is critical (spirit level recommended)
* **Vibration:** Use spring/rubber isolators (esp. above living/work spaces)
* **Clearances:** ≥500 mm front (service), ≥600 mm side (filter); access panels must be clear for filter change/maintenance
* **Filter access:** G4 + HEPA via front/side panel—ensure regular access for cleaning/replacement (3–6 months)

---

## 6. Ducting & Drainage

* **Ducting:**

  * Connect supply/return: Φ200 mm, fresh air: Φ150 mm (rigid, insulated duct preferred)
  * Keep runs short; avoid sharp bends, minimize pressure loss
  * Use flexible sections at connections for vibration/noise
  * Seal/insulate to prevent condensation
* **Drain:**

  * Attach Φ20 mm hose with **NO P-trap or U-trap** for gravity drainage
  * **IMPORTANT: Do NOT use P-traps on ducted dehumidifiers** - they can cause drainage backup and system malfunction
  * **Positive Air Pressure System:** DA-X units operate with positive air pressure in their drain systems, which means P-traps are not needed and can actually interfere with proper drainage flow
  * Ensure positive slope, no kinks, and smooth flow - straight run to drain point
  * Use a condensate pump only if gravity drain not possible
  * Connect to floor drain, sump, or exterior with direct drainage path

---

## 7. Electrical Requirements

* **Circuit:** Dedicated 220V/50Hz supply; check local code for RCD (≤30mA)
* **Current draw:** DA-X60i: 4.1A, DA-X140i: 8.5A (rated current)
* **Disconnect:** Install isolator switch near unit
* **Wiring:** Grounded, installed by licensed electrician
* **Voltage stability:** ±10% max fluctuation allowed
* **Wiring Diagram (Controller):** ![Controller Wiring Diagram](https://www.dehumsaust.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inverter-wiring.png)

---

## 8. Control & Operation

* **Smart Logic:** Maintains absolute humidity target (not just RH)
* **Sensor:** 5-in-1 (CO₂, PM2.5, TVOC, RH, Temp) auto-adjusts fresh air damper and operation
* **Fresh-Air Damper:** Electric, fully modulating (0–300 m³/h)
* **Controls:**

  * Touch controller on unit (menu for mode, timer, setpoint, status)
  * WiFi/app and Modbus planned (depends on model revision)
* **Display:** Shows supply/return air temp, RH, filter status, errors
* **Modes:** Auto (sensor-driven), manual, boost (high capacity), sleep/quiet
* **Timer:** Single-use (on/off), no recurring schedules (at this time)
* **Diagnostics:** Real-time fault reporting; logs available via service interface

---

## 9. Filtration

* **Stages:**

  * G4 (primary dust)
  * HEPA H13 (removes >99.97% of fine particles)
  * \[Some variants may also include F7 or TVOC modules, check model]
* **Maintenance:**

  * Access via front/side panel; inspect/replace every 3–6 months under normal use
  * HEPA must be replaced, not washed; G4 can be washed or replaced

---

## 10. Maintenance & Cleaning

* Unplug/isolate unit before service
* Clean exterior with damp cloth (no solvents)
* Check/replace G4 and HEPA filters regularly
* Inspect drain hose for kinks, blockages
* Annual check by qualified technician (electrical, refrigerant, fan, sensors)

---

## 11. Error/Fault Codes & Troubleshooting

* Faults and diagnostics shown on controller display
* Common errors: temperature/humidity sensor fault, communication, fan, damper, compressor, pressure protection, refrigerant
* Refer to manual/service menu for full error code list and remedies (manual in development, but follow standard FD-X/FD-EX error structure for now)
* Most faults: clear by power cycle; persistent: call service

---

## 12. Warranty & Support

* **Warranty:** 5 years parts, 2 years labor (manufacturing defects only; excludes wear/tear, consumables)
* **Support:** Phone and email assistance; spare parts/filters available locally
* **Contact:** Dehumidifiers Australia Pty Ltd ([sales@dehumsaust.com.au](mailto:sales@dehumsaust.com.au), 0447 728 037)

---

## 13. General Cautions & Compliance

* Must be installed/serviced by licensed HVAC/electrical professionals
* R32 refrigerant: flammable—do not install near ignition sources; leak test after install/service
* IPX4 protection for indoor use only
* Follow all relevant building/electrical codes (AS/NZS in AU)
* Ensure no blocked air inlets/outlets; keep filters clean for safety/performance
* All dimensions, specs, and features subject to change; refer to supplied documentation for latest info
