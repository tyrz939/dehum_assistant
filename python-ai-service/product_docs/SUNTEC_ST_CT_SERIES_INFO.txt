# SUNTEC ST & CT SERIES — MASTER RAG (AU/NZ 230V focus, with GPP notes)

Aliases:

* “STX00” = ST600 / ST1000 (timer-only, no humidistat)
* “STX01 Pro” = ST601 Pro / ST1001 Pro (humidistat + Wi-Fi)
* “CT801 Pro” = CT801 Pro (horizontal / stackable; humidistat + Wi-Fi; shows GPP)
* “GPP versions” = units whose display/app show In/Out GPP and use extended error codes (Er11–Er17) — includes STX01 Pro and CT801 Pro

---

## 1) What each model DOES (and DOES NOT) do

### ST600 / ST1000 (STX00)

* Control: **Timer only**. Continuous run until the timer ends. **No humidity set-point**.
* This means: they **cannot maintain a set RH%**. They simply run (or stop) by time.
* Typical use: restoration jobs where you just want max extraction for N hours.

### ST601 Pro / ST1001 Pro (STX01 Pro)

* Control: **Humidistat + Timer** + Wi-Fi app (Dry Connect). User sets RH% (25–80%) or runs continuous.
* Display: temp, RH, job/life timers; supports app scheduling, device sharing, grouping.
* Suitable when you must **maintain a target RH%** automatically.

### CT801 Pro

* Form factor: horizontal / stackable footprint for tight spaces/van work.
* Control & telemetry: like STX01 Pro (humidistat + Wi-Fi), plus **GPP readouts** (In/Out).
* Use when you want Pro features in a low-profile, lay-flat form.

Canned answer (keep handy):

> **Q: Can the ST600/ST1000 maintain 50% RH?**
> **A: No.** ST600/ST1000 are **timer-only constant-run** models. They do **not** have a humidistat and **cannot** maintain any set RH. If you need set-point control, pick **ST601 Pro/ST1001 Pro** or **CT801 Pro**.

## 2) Rated performance (230V models, AU/NZ)

* ST601 Pro: 65 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 39 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow \~600 m³/h; 920 W; 4.0 A.
* ST1001 Pro: 100 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 61 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow \~750 m³/h; 1650 W; 6.5 A.
* ST600: 65 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 39 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow \~600 m³/h; 920 W; 4.0 A.
* ST1000: 100 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 61 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow \~750 m³/h; 1650 W; 6.5 A.
* Operating range (typical): 1–38 °C.
* Refrigerant: R410A.
* Body: rotomoulded; big wheels; 10 m drain hose; \~8 m power cord.
* Size/weight (ST chassis): 500×485×840 mm; \~40–50 kg depending on model.

**CT801 Pro quick spec (230V):** \~52 L/day (AHAM 30 °C/80%RH), \~90 L/day saturated; \~700 m³/h; \~1150 W; \~5.0 A; 420×645×463 mm; \~38 kg.

Guidance for sizing (use in copy):

* AHAM 30 °C/80%RH ratings are **optimistic** for cool/dry sites; at \~15 °C/50%RH, expect **\~40–60% less output**. Use multiple units and air movers for cold, low-RH jobs.

---

## 3) Controls, Operating Modes & UI (what users will see)

### STX00 (ST600/1000)

* Keys: ON/OFF, TIMER, START/STOP, DISPLAY, PURGE.
* LCD icons: Dehumidifier ON, DEFROST, DELAY bar, JOB/TOTAL/TIMER clocks.
* Timer window: 00:00–23:50 (10-min steps). No RH set-point.
* PURGE empties the pump before transport.
* **Defrost cycle:** Auto hot-gas defrost engages when coil temp is low; unit pauses compressor and circulates air to clear frost. In cold sites, expect periodic defrosts.

### STX01 Pro (ST601/1001 Pro)

* Keys: ON/OFF, MENU, ADJUST, START/STOP, PURGE.
* Menus: CURRENT RH, SET RH, TIMER, JOB, TOTAL/LIFE, °C/°F, IN/OUT (Pro GPP models).
* RH set range: 25–80% (–– = continuous).
* Wi-Fi indicator states; Dry Connect app pairing (hold MENU 5 s from OFF).
* Modes: **Set RH% mode** maintains humidity; **Continuous** runs nonstop; defrost as per STX00.

### CT801 Pro

* Same Pro-class UI + GPP readouts (Inlet/Outlet Temp, RH, **GPP**). Great for documenting grain depression.
* Defrost: same logic as STX01 Pro.

---

## 4) Pumps, drainage, and transport

* Built-in **condensate pump** with long hose; purge automatically when full.
* **Before moving**: stop dehumidifying, wait \~10 min for drip-down, then **PURGE** (manual or via auto off-countdown on Pro models).
* Do **not** kink the drain hose; a kink will trip a pump error.

---

## 5) Error codes (match what customers report on screen)

### STX00 (ST600/ST1000)

* **Er01** — Pump problem / kinked tube; “PUMP ON” flashes.
* **Er02** — Coil temp sensor fault.
* **Er03** — Ambient temp sensor fault.
  (Dehu may stop or keep running depending on code; service if persistent.)

### STX01 Pro (ST601/1001 Pro) — legacy codes

* **Er00** — Pump problem / kinked tube (PUMP ON flashes).
* **Er01** — Coil temp sensor fault.
* **Er02** — Ambient temp sensor fault.
* **Er03** — Humidistat sensor fault.
* **Er04** — Ambient temp too high (unit protects itself).

### “GPP versions” (extended codes on newer Pro displays / CT801 Pro)

* **Er11** — Pump / drain tube issue (“PURGE” flashes).
* **Er12** — Coil temperature sensor (TC).
* **Er13** — Inlet temperature sensor (TI).
* **Er14** — Inlet humidity sensor (HI).
* **Er15** — Outlet temperature sensor (TO).
* **Er16** — Outlet humidity sensor (HO).
* **Er17** — Ambient/inlet temp too high (>100 °F ≈ >38 °C).
  (Er11–Er17 stop dehumidification; unit returns to Standby until resolved.)

## 6) Field setup & best practice (short, actionable chunks)

* **Create a sealed drying chamber.** Close outside openings; keep air moving with fans.
* **Place centrally; keep intakes/outlets clear.**
* **Cold sites (<20 °C):** expect big capacity drop; add heat & airflow; expect more defrost.
* **Filters:** pleated; vacuum only; do **not** wash. Replace after 3x cleanings or any mould job.
* **Power:** grounded outlet; no cheater plugs.
* **Transport:** if laid down, stand upright \~30 min before start.

---

## 7) Maintenance & consumables

* **Filter:** inspect weekly on dusty jobs; vacuum; replace after 3 cleans or if damaged/mould.
* **Pump:** test purge weekly in long-term deployments; clean float/sump every 6 months.
* **Coils:** inspect quarterly; clean with coil-safe cleaner; rinse gently.
* **Wi-Fi/App troubleshooting:** ensure 2.4 GHz network, strong signal; reset module (hold MENU 10 s) and re-pair; disable VPN during pairing; keep router within 10 m.

---

## 8) Quick selection guide (sales assist)

* Need **set-point control** (maintain 50% RH), logs, remote app? → **ST601 Pro / ST1001 Pro / CT801 Pro**.
* Need **constant run** with simple timer (price-sensitive, basic jobs)? → **ST600 / ST1000**.
* Tight spaces / stack flat in vans? → **CT801 Pro**.
* Cold jobs (1–10 °C)? All will run, but expect slow extraction; add heat/air movers.

---

## 9) Physicals & logistics (fast reference)

* **Chassis (ST)**: 500×485×840 mm; 40–50 kg; wheels + fold-down handle; 10 m hose; \~8 m cord.
* **Chassis (CT801 Pro)**: 420×645×463 mm; \~38 kg; low-profile stackable.
* **Noise**: \~60 dB (ST600/601 Pro), \~65 dB (ST1000/1001 Pro, CT801 Pro).

---

## 10) App basics (Dry Connect)

* 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only; pair by holding MENU 5 s (beep).
* App features: On/Off, **Continuous Run**, **Set RH%**, **Timer & Schedules**, Logs, Device Sharing, Group Control, Lock.

---

## 11) Tech service notes (triage)

* No power/LCD dark: verify mains, L/N to board, transformer \~10.6 V, board fuse.
* No water / poor performance: confirm “Water Drop/DEHUMIDIFIER ON” icon, compressor cold test, capacitors/overload, fan/capacitor, blocked filter or hose.
* Leaks: check for **kinked** discharge tube; inspect/clean pump float & shaft; verify float switches.
* Parts location: transformer/terminal/fan capacitor under control panel; compressor capacitor on rear plate.

---

## 12) FAQ snippets (drop-in answers)

* **Will ST600/ST1000 hold 50% RH overnight?**
  No. They’re **timer-only**; choose **ST601 Pro/CT801 Pro** for set-point control.

* **What’s GPP and why do I care?**
  GPP = grains of water per pound of dry air. GPP drop (In→Out) proves moisture removal and helps document drying progress. **CT801 Pro/STX01 Pro GPP models** display this.

* **My screen says Er11 / Er00. What now?**
  Likely a pump/tube issue (kink or blockage). Straighten/clear the hose and purge. If error persists, service the pump and float.

---

## 13) Safety & limits (copy/paste)

* Operate between \~1–38 °C.
* Keep wiring/motor dry; never in standing water.
* Always earth the unit; use proper gauge grounded leads; no adapters.
* Don’t block intakes/outlets; run upright; purge before transport.

---

## 14) Glossary (for retrieval)

* **Timer-only / Constant-run** = ST600 / ST1000; no humidistat; cannot maintain set RH.
* **Humidistat** = ST601 Pro / ST1001 Pro / CT801 Pro; can maintain set RH.
* **GPP models** = Pro models with In/Out GPP and extended **Er11–Er17** codes.
* **PURGE** = manual/auto pump empty before transport.
* **AHAM** = 30 °C/80%RH rating; real jobs colder/drier → lower yields.
