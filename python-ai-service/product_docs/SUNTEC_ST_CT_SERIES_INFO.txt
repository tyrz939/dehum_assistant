## 3. Capacity Derating & Performance Notes

**IMPORTANT:** All dehumidifier capacities are rated at **30°C, 80% RH** (AHAM standard conditions). Performance will drop considerably at lower temperatures and humidity levels:

* **Lower temperatures** (below 20°C): Capacity can drop 40-60%
* **Lower humidity** (below 60% RH): Capacity can drop 30-50%
* **Combined effect** (cool + dry conditions): Capacity may drop 60-70%

**Examples for Restoration Work:**
- ST1001 Pro (62L AHAM rated) may only extract 25-35L/day at 15°C/50%RH
- CT801 Pro (52L AHAM rated) may only extract 20-30L/day at 15°C/50%RH

**For disaster restoration projects:** Size equipment based on actual site conditions, not rated capacity. Use multiple units for faster drying in challenging conditions.
