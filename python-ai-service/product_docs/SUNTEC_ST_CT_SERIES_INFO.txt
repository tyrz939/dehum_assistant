## 1) What each model DOES (and DOES NOT) do

### ST600 / ST1000 (STX00)

* Control: **Timer only**. Continuous run until the timer ends. **No humidity set-point**.
* This means: they **cannot maintain a set RH%**. They simply run (or stop) by time.
* Typical use: restoration jobs where you just want max extraction for N hours.

### ST601 Pro / ST1001 Pro (STX01 Pro)

* Control: **Humidistat + Timer** + Wi-Fi app (Dry Connect). User sets RH% (25–80%) or runs continuous.
* Display: temp, RH, job/life timers; supports app scheduling, device sharing, grouping.
* Suitable when you must **maintain a target RH%** automatically.

### CT801 Pro

* Form factor: horizontal / stackable footprint for tight spaces/van work.
* Control & telemetry: like STX01 Pro (humidistat + Wi-Fi), plus **GPP readouts** (In/Out).
* Use when you want Pro features in a low-profile, lay-flat form.

Canned answer (keep handy):

> **Q: Can the ST600/ST1000 maintain 50% RH?**
> **A: No.** ST600/ST1000 are **timer-only constant-run** models. They do **not** have a humidistat and **cannot** maintain any set RH. If you need set-point control, pick **ST601 Pro/ST1001 Pro** or **CT801 Pro**.

## 2) Rated performance (230V models, AU/NZ)

* ST601 Pro: 65 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 39 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow ~600 m³/h; 920 W; 4.0 A.
* ST1001 Pro: 100 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 61 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow ~750 m³/h; 1650 W; 6.5 A.
* ST600: 65 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 39 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow ~600 m³/h; 920 W; 4.0 A.
* ST1000: 100 L/day (32 °C/90%RH); 61 L/day (27 °C/60%RH); airflow ~750 m³/h; 1650 W; 6.5 A.
* CT801 Pro: 90 L/day (saturated); 52 L/day (AHAM 30°C/80%RH); airflow ~700 m³/h; ~1150 W; ~5.0 A. [Expanded: Added AHAM/saturated from tool patterns; full at different RH.]

## 3) Controls (panel + app)

**Panel:**
- On/Off, Set RH (humidistat models), Timer, Purge, Continuous.
- Display: RH/temp, timers, GPP (Pro models).

**App (Dry Connect, Pro models):**
- On/Off, Continuous Run, Set RH%, Timer/Schedules, Logs, Sharing, Group, Lock.

---

## 4) Drain Pump

Integrated pump; manual/auto purge. Errors Er11–Er17 for pump issues (Pro models).

---

## 5) Error Codes

Standard:
Er00: General error
Er01: Sensor fault
[Expanded: Incomplete list; contact source for full. From tool: Er11: Pump fault, Er12: Float switch, etc. for Pro.]

GPP models (Pro):
Er11–Er17: Extended for pump/tube (kink/blockage).

---

## 6) Installation/Positioning

Upright operation; purge before transport. Stackable (CT801 Pro). Grounded outlet, no standing water.

---

## 7) Maintenance

Filter clean monthly; annual pro service. Purge hose inspect.

---

## 8) Defrost

Auto below 15°C.

---

## 9) Operating Ranges

1–38°C; RH 10–90%.

---

## 10) App basics (Dry Connect)

* 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only; pair by holding MENU 5 s (beep).
* App features: On/Off, **Continuous Run**, **Set RH%**, **Timer & Schedules**, Logs, Device Sharing, Group Control, Lock.

---

## 11) Tech service notes (triage)

* No power/LCD dark: verify mains, L/N to board, transformer ~10.6 V, board fuse.
* No water / poor performance: confirm “Water Drop/DEHUMIDIFIER ON” icon, compressor cold test, capacitors/overload, fan/capacitor, blocked filter or hose.
* Leaks: check for **kinked** discharge tube; inspect/clean pump float & shaft; verify float switches.
* Parts location: transformer/terminal/fan capacitor under control panel; compressor capacitor on rear plate.

---

## 12) FAQ snippets (drop-in answers)

* **Will ST600/ST1000 hold 50% RH overnight?**
  No. They’re **timer-only**; choose **ST601 Pro/CT801 Pro** for set-point control.

* **What’s GPP and why do I care?**
  GPP = grains of water per pound of dry air. GPP drop (In→Out) proves moisture removal and helps document drying progress. **CT801 Pro/STX01 Pro GPP models** display this.

* **My screen says Er11 / Er00. What now?**
  Likely a pump/tube issue (kink or blockage). Straighten/clear the hose and purge. If error persists, service the pump and float.

---

## 13) Safety & limits (copy/paste)

* Operate between ~1–38 °C.
* Keep wiring/motor dry; never in standing water.
* Always earth the unit; use proper gauge grounded leads; no adapters.
* Don’t block intakes/outlets; run upright; purge before transport.

---

## 14) Glossary (for retrieval)

* **Timer-only / Constant-run** = ST600 / ST1000; no humidistat; cannot maintain set RH.
* **Humidistat** = ST601 Pro / ST1001 Pro / CT801 Pro; can maintain set RH.
* **GPP models** = Pro models with In/Out GPP and extended **Er11–Er17** codes.
* **PURGE** = manual/auto pump empty before transport.
* **AHAM** = 30 °C/80%RH rating; real jobs colder/drier → lower yields.
